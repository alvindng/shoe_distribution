# _Shoe Distribution_

#### _Individual Ruby Exercise for Epicodus - Ruby week 4, 7.22.16._

#### By _**Alvin Ng**_

## Description
**Shoe Distribution**

Website showcasing everything I learned in week 4 Ruby of Epicodus. This application is to incorporate all the concepts taught this week by creating a program to track shoe brands and what stores they are in. Here are the user stories:

* As a user, I want to be able to add, update, delete and list shoe stores.
* As a user, I want to be able to add shoe brands in the application (don't worry about updating, listing or destroying shoe brands).
* As a user, I want to be able to add shoe brands to a store to show where they are sold.
* As a user, I want to be able to see all of the brands a store sells on the individual store page.
* As a user, I want store names and shoe brands to be saved with a capital letter no matter how I enter them.
* As a user, I do not want stores and shoes to be saved if I enter a blank name.
